Using the contents of the sonata/contrib/gentoo you can install the application Sonata by creating a local overlay Gentoo.

1. You need to create a directory and copy the contents to this place:
/usr/local/portage/media-sound/sonata

2. You need to create the directory /usr/local/portage/metadata and create a file called layout.tsonf with this content:

    # Autogenerated and managed by crossdev
    
    # Delete the above line if you want to manage this file yourself
    
    masters = gentoo


where, after the word gentoo should indicate through gap also overlays that are connected for example with Layman

3. Open the file for editing /etc/portage/make.conf (/etc/make.conf on old style) and add the line:

    PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/portage $PORTDIR_OVERLAY"


line should be above announcements GENTOO_MIRRORS

4. Run the installation from the console

    sudo emerge -av --quiet-build =media-sound/sonata-9999
