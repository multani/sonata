How to contribute?
------------------

If you are interested to send me some changes, please consider the following:

#. Clone my repository or fork it on Github;
#. **For each** feature, bug fix, refactor, anything, you want to submit to me,
   create a branch with a name which reflects what you want to do;
#. Commit your changes related to *this* thing in this branch;
#. Signal your changes with one of the following
   * send a mail to jon+sonata@multani.info with the URL of your repository, the
     name of the branch you want to be merged, and a meaningful description of
     your work;
   * send me your patch(es) to jon+sonata@multani.info using ``git send-email``;
   * open a pull request on Github.

I hate, hate, *hate* having to review 20 unrelated commits with 1000+ lines
changed, this is the easiest way for your changes not to be merged.
