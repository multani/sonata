v0.7
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length)
	library tab -> albums, artists, search
	ability to configure columns for playlist
	ability to show column headings for sorting

Future:
	dbus - show previous instance if user tries to launch another
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	border around album art?
	pref to autoplay when using 'replace'?
	use threading for album art
	retain selection after dnd
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	Stream support(?)
	treeview instead of listview? (expanding, collapsing..)
	lyrics?
