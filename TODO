v0.9
	song properties (metadata)
	USE COMMAND_LIST_* for batch processes (i.e. remove, crop, add_*)
		Add to > Next song, top, random
	Stream support
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	make remote images non-blocking
	sonata --play, --pause, --stop, etc
	preserve aspect ratio of images (up to max of 160x160)
	show notification on unpause

Future:
	allow multiple columns?
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length, etc)?
