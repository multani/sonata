v1.0
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	GtkStatusIcon - iterate more often to check for cursor?
	ability to edit tags (taglib + tagpy = optional)
	- recurse into a directory's subdirs
	- if you hold down alt-s, doesn't update properly in sonata..
	some way to bring up the info viewer when art is disabled
	if sonata is stopped when loading, notif window is too wide..
