v1.6
	empty string searching doesn't work with mpd < 0.14...
	threaded method for artwork - possible threading traceback when exiting sonata
	enabling/disabling outputs
	prevent vertical resizing when collapsed 
	save to playlist.. default to selected files? pref?
	sonata freezes with gail/accessibility enabled during new library searching

Future:
	support for new idle command (waiting on python-mpd)
	work with mpd's new "allow authenticated local users to add any local file to the playlist"
		- waiting on python-mpd to implement unix socket paths
		- dnd from a file manager (implemented and untested because of above)
		- new library browsing mode to open any file?
		  remember: no tags and implications for remote mpd users.

		- fix reasonable pychecker/pylint warnings
	tests:
		- write automated tests
		- refactor code into parts that can be tested
	use the logging module:
