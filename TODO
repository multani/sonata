v1.3
	treeview
		- better algorithm for sorting song length (e.g. 1:10 vs 10:10)
		- reordering rows is faster than reloading (see http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&file=faq13.049.htp)
	allow additional columns for library (like current)
	pref for lyrics saving location..

v1.4
	genre mode (genre -> artist -> album)
	better playlist support (mpd 0.13 only):
		playlist tab:
			ability to view songs, reorder songs, remove songs, etc
		current tab:
			- save... >
				new playlist...
				to existing playlist... ---> popup window with dropdown of playlists
				...
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	dnd from other tabs to playlist tabs
	
Future:
	libnotify?
	test multiple streams at once..
	crop songs in current playlist?
	mpd statistics
	hover over album art -> show larger image in borderless popup after 0.5 sec?
	use GtkVolumeButton?
