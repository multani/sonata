v1.3
	pref for lyrics saving location..
	queueing with multiple playlist columns: adjust column widths better
	why the heck doesn't the treeviewcolumn header arrow update when sorting is reversed?

v1.4
	allow additional columns for library (like current)
	genre mode (genre -> artist -> album)
	better playlist support (mpd 0.13 only):
		playlist tab:
			ability to view songs, reorder songs, remove songs, etc
		current tab:
			- save... >
				new playlist...
				to existing playlist... ---> popup window with dropdown of playlists
				...
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	dnd from other tabs to playlist tabs
	
Future:
	libnotify?
	test multiple streams at once..
	crop songs in current playlist?
	mpd statistics
	hover over album art -> show larger image in borderless popup after 0.5 sec?
	use GtkVolumeButton?
