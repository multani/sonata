Future:

	work with mpd's new "allow authenticated local users to add any local file to the playlist"
		- waiting on python-mpd to implement unix socket paths
		- dnd from a file manager (implemented and untested because of above)
		- new library browsing mode to open any file?
		  remember: no tags and implications for remote mpd users.

clean-up
	extract duplicate code into functions, classes etc.
	document interfaces and implementation
	modularity:
		- limit module size to 1000 lines
		- limit dependencies between modules
	style:
		- rewrite unpythonic or complicated parts
		- fix reasonable pychecker/pylint warnings
	tests:
		- write automated tests
		- refactor code into parts that can be tested
	use the logging module:
		- add verbose and debug logging modes
		- log to file if not running on console
	exceptions:
		- add class restrictions to most "except:" clauses
		- add debug logging to most except clauses
	threading:
		- design, document, and implement a bug-free use of threads
