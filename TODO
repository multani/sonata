v1.0
	support for PLS, M3U, etc (http://www.scvi.net/pls.htm) if mpd
		doesn't support it natively (feature request filed)
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length, etc)?

Future:
	USE COMMAND_LIST_* for batch processes (i.e. remove, crop, add_*)
		Add to > Next song, top, random
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	lyrics? last.fm?
