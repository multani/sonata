This module contains various constant definitions that any other
module can import without risk of cyclic imports.

Most of the constants are enum-like, that is, they provide symbolic
names for a set of values.

XXX Should some of these be moved to be private in some module, or
into config?

Example usage:
from consts import consts
...
if view == consts.VIEW_ALBUM: ...
